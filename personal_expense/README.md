# personal_expense

First Flutter project allowing me to have a first dive into :
-  how widgets work 
-  how to make an app responsive
-  how to make the app adaptive depending on which OS it's running...

App allows you to enter any expense and save it. It shows all expenses in a list and creates a chart showing the past week expenses. Each will be represented by a bar. On which bar, will be represented the percentage of spent amount during the past week.
No DB is set, only local storage is used. So any refresh or app rebuild will erase all data. 

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

## To run it 

- First open a device on which you can simulate the app: iOS device with XCode or Android Studio for Android.
- then cd into `personal_expense` forlder and run `flutter run`
  Note: if you're using `VSCode` you may run the app from `Run` in the toolbar.
